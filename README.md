    "command": "workbench.action.files.newUntitledFile"
  }
]

This example sets Ctrl + Alt + N to create a new untitled file.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Setting up and starting debugging a simple program in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves a few straightforward steps. VS Code provides a robust debugging environment with various features that make it easy to identify and fix issues in your code. Below are the steps to set up and debug a simple program and an overview of some key debugging features available in VS Code.
Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging a Simple Program
Step 1: Install Necessary Extensions

Before you can debug your code, ensure you have the appropriate language extension installed. For example, if you are debugging a Python program, you should install the Python extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

    Open Extensions View:
        Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar or press Ctrl + Shift + X.
        Search for the relevant extension (e.g., "Python" for Python debugging) and click Install.

Step 2: Open or Create a New Project

    Open Folder:
        Go to File > Open Folder... or use Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O and navigate to your project folder.
    Create New File:
        Go to File > New File or press Ctrl + N to create a new file.
        Save it with an appropriate file extension for the language you are using (e.g., .py for Python, .js for JavaScript).

Step 3: Write or Open Your Code

Write a simple program in your language of choice. For instance, you could use the following Python code to calculate the sum of numbers:

python

# sum.py
def sum_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = sum_numbers(5, 3)
    print(f"The result is {result}")

Step 4: Open the Debug Panel

    Open Debug View:
        Click on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar or press Ctrl + Shift + D.
        The Debug panel will open on the left side.

Step 5: Configure the Debugger

    Add Configuration:
        Click on Create a launch.json file link in the Debug panel.
        Choose the appropriate environment. For Python, select Python File. This will create a launch.json file in a .vscode folder inside your project directory.

    Configure launch.json:
        Ensure your launch.json file looks something like this for Python:

        json

        {
          "version": "0.2.0",
          "configurations": [
            {
              "name": "Python: Current File",
              "type": "python",
              "request": "launch",
              "program": "${file}",
              "console": "integratedTerminal"
            }
          ]
        }

        Adjust the settings as needed for your project and language.

Step 6: Set Breakpoints

    Set Breakpoints:
        Open the file you want to debug.
        Click in the left margin next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear to indicate a breakpoint.

Step 7: Start Debugging

    Start Debugging:
        Click the green Play button in the Debug toolbar or press F5.
        The debugger will start, and execution will stop at your breakpoints.

    Observe Variables and Execution:
        Use the Variables pane to inspect variable values.
        Use the Call Stack pane to see the current execution stack.

Step 8: Use Debugging Controls

    Control Execution:
        Continue: Press F5 to continue execution until the next breakpoint.
        Step Over: Press F10 to move to the next line of code without entering functions.
        Step Into: Press F11 to step into functions.
        Step Out: Press Shift + F11 to step out of the current function.

    Evaluate Expressions:
        Use the Debug Console to evaluate expressions and run commands.

Step 9: Stop Debugging

    Stop Debugging:
        Click the red Stop button in the Debug toolbar or press Shift + F5.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code

VS Code offers several powerful debugging features to enhance your debugging experience:
1. Breakpoints

    Set Breakpoints: Click next to the line number to set breakpoints.
    Conditional Breakpoints: Right-click on a breakpoint and add a condition, such as variable values or expressions.
    Logpoints: Use logpoints to log messages to the console without stopping execution, useful for tracing.

2. Variable Inspection

    Variables Pane: Inspect the values of variables and objects during execution.
    Watch Expressions: Add expressions to watch and see how their values change over time.

3. Call Stack

    Call Stack Pane: View the current call stack and navigate through the different frames to see how the program reached the current state.

4. Debug Console

    Interactive Console: Evaluate expressions, execute commands, and print variable values in the Debug Console.

5. Step Controls

    Step Over (F10): Move to the next line of code without entering functions.
    Step Into (F11): Enter functions to debug deeper into the code.
    Step Out (Shift + F11): Exit the current function and return to the calling function.
    Restart (Ctrl + Shift + F5): Restart the debugging session without stopping it.

6. Exception Handling

    Catch Exceptions: Configure the debugger to break on exceptions.
    Uncaught Exceptions: You can set the debugger to stop on exceptions that are not caught.

7. Debugging Configurations

    Multi-target Debugging: Configure multiple debugging targets in launch.json for complex applications.
    Launch Configurations: Customize the launch.json file to set up specific debugging scenarios, including running different scripts or commands before or after debugging.

8. Remote Debugging

    Attach to Remote: Debug applications running on remote machines or within containers by configuring remote debugging settings.

9. Integrated Terminal

    Run and Debug: Use the integrated terminal for running scripts and observing output without leaving the editor.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Integrating Git with VS Code for version control is a breeze!

 Here's how it works:

Initializing a Repository:

    Open your project folder in VS Code.
    Look for the Source Control view (usually on the left sidebar). If it's not visible, go to View > Source Control (or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G).
    If VS Code doesn't detect an existing Git repository, you'll see an "Initialize Repository" button. Click on that. This is equivalent to running git init in the command line and creates the necessary files for Git to track changes.

Making Commits:

    After making changes to your code, VS Code will show the status of each file in the Source Control view.

    Unchanged files will appear normal.
    Modified files will be highlighted.
    New files will have a green "+" sign.

    To stage changes (tell Git you want to include them in the next commit), you can:
        Click the "+" icon next to the file in the Source Control view.
        Right-click the file and select "Stage Changes."
    Once you've staged all the desired changes, open the Source Control view. You'll see a text box where you can write a commit message describing your changes. A good commit message should be concise and informative.
    Click the commit button (usually a checkmark symbol) or use the shortcut Ctrl+Enter to create a commit.

Pushing Changes to GitHub:

    Assuming you have a GitHub account and a repository set up, you'll need to connect VS Code to it. You can sign in to VS Code with your GitHub account (refer to VS Code documentation for details).
    Once connected, open the Source Control view. You should see a section with your remote repositories (including GitHub).
    If this is the first time pushing to this repository, you'll need to configure a remote. You can do this through the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Git: Add Remote." Provide the URL of your GitHub repository.
    With the remote configured, you can simply click the "Push" button (upward arrow icon) in the Source Control view to push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
